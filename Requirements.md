### **Requirements**
- **System Functionality**:  
  - Develop a system to manage Pok√©mon battles, tracking their status (capabilities, health, battles won/lost).
  - Allow dynamic definition of new Pok√©mon.
  - Use Java Reflection for handling dynamic objects.
- **UML Class (Model) Diagram (~50% of grade)**:  
  - 3 to 10 classes with attributes, operations, and relationships.
  - Proper cardinalities and visibility notation.
  - Omit simple getters and setters.
- **UML Sequence Diagrams (2 diagrams, each ~25% of grade)**:  
  - One diagram for a battle where Pok√©mon X attacks, and Pok√©mon Y does not defend.
  - One diagram for a battle where Pok√©mon Y attacks, and Pok√©mon X defends.
  - Include lifeline boxes, messages, object creation, and control structures.
- **Battle Mechanics**:  
  - Turn-based system where Pok√©mon attack or defend based on their health percentage.
  - Randomized selection of attacks and defenses.
  - Implement attack damage calculations with defensive reductions.
  - Maintain consistency using Java‚Äôs `Random` with seed values.
- **Evaluation Criteria**:  
  - Object-oriented design principles.
  - Consistency between design artifacts and implementation.
  - Passes a set of provided and hidden test cases.

### **Submission Details**
- **Submission via Canvas**:  
  - **class_diagram.pdf** (UML Class Diagram)
  - **sequence_diagram.pdf** (UML Sequence Diagrams)
  - Multiple files allowed for readability (e.g., `class_diagram1.pdf`, `sequence_diagram2.pdf`).
- **Submission Guidelines**:  
  - Must be completed in an approved group.
  - Notify instructors via Canvas or Ed Discussion before the due date if technical issues arise.
  - Late submissions likely won‚Äôt be accepted.
  - Unlimited submissions allowed before the deadline.
- **Testing & Iteration**:  
  - Expected to iterate on designs and implementations.
  - System must handle dynamically introduced Pok√©mon after submission.
  - Office hours available for clarifications.
 
### **Attack/Defense Rate Logic**  
A Pok√©mon decides whether to **attack or defend** based on its **current HP ratio** (current HP / max HP):  

- **HP ‚â• 70%** ‚Üí **80% chance to attack**, 20% chance to defend.  
- **30% ‚â§ HP < 70%** ‚Üí **50% chance to attack**, 50% chance to defend.  
- **HP < 30%** ‚Üí **30% chance to attack**, 70% chance to defend.  

‚úÖ **Attack Selection**: If attacking, the Pok√©mon picks an attack **randomly** from its available skills (uniform probability).  
‚úÖ **Defense Selection**: If defending, the Pok√©mon picks a defensive move **randomly** from its available skills (uniform probability).  

üîπ **Damage Calculation**:  
- If the Pok√©mon defended last turn: **Final damage = Attack Damage - Defense Reduction** (can be reduced to 0).  
- If the Pok√©mon did NOT defend: **Full attack damage applies**.  
- All fractional damage values are **rounded up** (ceiling function).

### **Seed Mechanism for Randomness**  
Java‚Äôs `Random` class is used to **control battle randomness** consistently using a seed value.  

üîπ **Seed Rules**:  
- The `setseed,<Value>` command assigns a seed for randomness.  
  - Pok√©mon 1 gets `<Value>`, Pok√©mon 2 gets `<Value + 1>`.  
- The `removeseed()` command **removes the effect** of the previously set seed.  
- The system must support **multiple setseed and removeseed commands before a battle**.  
- If no seed is set, randomness is uncontrolled.  
- The `stop` command **gracefully terminates** the simulation.
